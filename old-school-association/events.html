                <p>The National President, FGC Vandeikya Old Students Association (FEDVOSA) Mr Agor Sesugh earlier today, was at FGC Vandeikya for an eye seeing and evaluation of the level of damages caused by fire yesterday. On Mr President's visit, were some members of his EXCOs. The national president was received by the Vice Principal, at FGC Vandeikya.

                    The school management will be  making an official statement about the fire outback soon. Until then, we can confirm that no life was lost. The JSS3 block (former Junior Dom) male hostel is the only block affected. The affected students have been redistributed to other hostels.
                    The hostel block was completely raised down by fire. Although, normal academic activities in the college are going on, except to the fact that the affected students are just left with the uniforms they had on as at the time of the incidence.
                    Mr President described the fire outbreak that gutted the students hostel as an unfortunate incidence.  He commended the bravery of the college community for preventing the fire from wrecking more havoc. 
                    Mr President also acknowledged the efforts of the Principal, St Peters Secondary School Vandeikya. Rev. Fr. Linus Huabo, who stood by FGC Vandeikya during the time of this ugly incidence.
                                    While we await the outcome of the investigation into the cause of the fire outbreak which is ongoing, our prayers and thoughts are with particularly the affected students and the entire college community.</p>

                <p>Greatest FEDVOSITES
                    Greetings to you all
                    Let me first of all appreciate this mandate bestowed upon me as the National president of our esteemed association. I am deeply honored to be found worthy to lead FEDVOSA at this point in time.                    
                    This position I understand requires mending fences and outreach to one and all bringing us together for the primary purpose of strengthening forces for both individual and collective growth. It also involves effective collaboration with our Alma mata  to stimulate infrastructural renewal, establishment of development projects and internalization of noble ideals in current students such that later in life they would become agents of positive change. All these I’m excited we have kick started and I assure you that we will be moving quickly in achieving our immediate and long term goals. Our desire is to make FGC Vandeikya a cynosure of all eyes in the academic world while also supporting the network of old students who will in turn raise the profile of the school.                    
                    In response to our key role in the sustenance of our alma mata especially giving back to the school in very may ways we deem fit based on the pressing needs of the school, the current Exco is proposing the construction of a students center at FGC Vandeikya. (The Architectural model attached).                     
                    The student center is leisure spot that has a tuck shop and sit out for students at FGC Vandeikya to relax and unwind. You may recall that this was deliberated upon by during the last congress meeting and exhaustively at the expanded EXCO level. The proposed students center was a request put forward by the Principal to the old students. The school doesn't have a befitting tuck shop. What serves this purpose is the one we all used to know right from the early days of FGC Vandeikya. And considering the size, position and porous nature of the structure ( Students breaking in at times) and the fact that students have to stand while they take their light refreshment, the idea of the students center was conceived.                    
                    The proposed students center is to house a tuck shop and sitting area, where students can buy and comfortably take their light refreshment                    
                    The estimated cost of the project is Six million Naira (N6,000,000) only. An amount which I believe we can collectively raise. We intend to source this money within ourselves and every FEDVOSITE is expected to make a donation of at least one thousand naira (N1000) towards this project. This is not a benchmark as we will gladly accept more in terms of finances, materials and professional assistance. The set presidents will help in collecting these funds.                     
                    The various sets presidents have been drafted to form the building committee and will be giving you updates from time to time. The project is intended to commence by the first week of August this year.
                    We look forward to your positive response to this call and I sincerely appreciate you all for all you do and that which you intend to do for this association.                    
                    Regards                    
                    Agor Sesugh
